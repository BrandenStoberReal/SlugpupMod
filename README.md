# SlugpupMod
A simple RainWorld mod I was asked to create which prevents some supposedly friendly creatures from dropkicking your children because they feel like it.

Obviously requires the Downpour DLC.

# Current Patches
* Friendly lizards no longer consume your children
* Guardians no longer dropkick your children if you are "friendly" towards them
